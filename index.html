        <div class="panel">
          <p>The majority of our challenges are free, yes. We do have some that are premium and require a Pro
            subscription to access. It will say on each challenge whether they are free or premium, so it's easy to tell
            the difference.</p>

        <div class="panel">
          <p>Definitely! Please do feel free to use whatever you build in your portfolio. Helping developers add
            professional-looking projects to their portfolio was one of the reasons we created this platform!</p>

        <div class="panel">
          <p>The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our Discord server. There are thousands of
            other
            developers in there, so it's a great place to ask questions. We even have a dedicated "help" channel! If you
            haven't joined yet, you can get an invite to our Discord server here.</p>
